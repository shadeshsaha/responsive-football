            <p>
                The 2021 Copa América was the 47th edition of the Copa América, the international men's football
                championship organized by South America's football ruling body CONMEBOL. The tournament took place in
                Brazil from 13 June to 10 July 2021. The tournament was originally scheduled to take place from 12 June
                to 12 July 2020 in Argentina and Colombia as the 2020 Copa América. On 17 March 2020, CONMEBOL announced
                that due to the COVID-19 pandemic in South America, the tournament had been postponed for a year, in
                conjunction with UEFA's decision to also postpone UEFA Euro 2020 to 2021. This was the first time since
                1991 where no guest nation took part in the tournament.
